# MistralChatGPT

Introducing MistralChatGPT, a fork of [BetterChatGPT](https://github.com/ztjhz/BetterChatGPT) to make it easy to use Mistral.AI models.

This is a fork of MistralChatGPT that includes newer models!

* Includes newer models (22b and Codestral) 
* Includes my attempt at using the free Codestral API (Autoswaps API Key when using free model)

**Free Codestral API Endpoint does not work yet - Kept getting CORS on direct connection and 404 on Proxy but should autochange API Key when using model, will also have it change endpoint whenever it works**

## Docker
```docker pull 0xgingi/mistralchatgpt:latest```

```docker run -p 3030:3030 -d --restart=always 0xgingi/mistralchatgpt```
